### ✅ Test Framework Quality
- **Protractor-based testing**: Uses industry-standard Protractor framework with Jasmine for reliable browser automation.

- **Page Object Model**: Implements maintainable test architecture with reusable page objects and helper methods.

- **Comprehensive assertions**: Custom matchers provide clear, domain-specific test assertions.

- **Error handling**: Tests cover both success and failure scenarios with proper error validation.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Test Execution Options
```bash
# Full test suite
npm run test:e2e

# Individual test suites
npm run test:e2e:auth
npm run test:e2e:profile
npm run test:e2e:session
npm run test:e2e:leaderboard
npm run test:e2e:admin

# Smoke tests for CI/CD
npm run test:e2e:smoke
